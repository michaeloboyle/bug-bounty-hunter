# ChatGPT Deep Research Prompt: Automated Bug Bounty Hunting System

## Core Research Objective

Design a comprehensive, autonomous bug bounty hunting system optimized for maximum profitability while maintaining ethical boundaries and operational safety. The system will be executed through Claude Flow agents with minimal human intervention.

## System Requirements

### Primary Objectives
1. **Autonomy**: 95%+ automated operation from target identification to vulnerability submission
2. **Safety**: Zero false positives, no system damage, ethical disclosure only
3. **Profitability**: $25,000+/month revenue target with <40% operational costs

### Execution Framework
- **Primary Platform**: Claude Flow (claude.ai/flow) for agent orchestration
- **Agent Architecture**: Multi-specialized agents working in coordinated pipelines
- **Human Oversight**: Strategic decisions only, no tactical execution

## Deep Research Areas
